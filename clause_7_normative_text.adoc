== Flattening the Schema
The CDB Shapefile standard provides three attribution schemas to represent attribution data.  Those three have been flattened into two for use with GeoPackage.  

•	Instance-level attribution schema
•	Extended-level attribution schema

As CNAM in the CDB Shapefile schema was only used as a relationship field, it has been removed from the flattened schema. Figure 1 shows the flattened instance and class-level attributes, and how the extended attributes link to a feature. I_CEAI, I_GEAI, and I_VEAI are all instance-level attributes and are linked to a specific feature.  C_CEAI, C_GEAI, and C_VEAI are all class-level attributes and are linked to all features in a layer.

Example: 
Record ID 4 in the extended-level attributes table is related to record ID 1 in the linear features table and is an instance-level attribute.  Record IDs 5 and 8 are also linked to record ID 4, and all apply to the same linear feature.  Note that a 0 in the LNK column denotes the end of the applicable record list. 
Record 9 in the extended-level attributes table is a class-level attribute related to all features that are present in the highway layer.

All of the information that is needed to instance features is organized in accordance to the CDB tile structure.  All the tiled GeoPackage dataset files are located in the same directory. The dataset’s second component selector (CS2) is used to differentiate between files with the same extension or with the same Vector features.  Table 1 presents the list of codes that are allocated.  Note that Vector datasets do not necessarily use all of the Dataset Component Selector 2 reserved codes.  Users of the CDB standard should refer to the appropriate section for an enumeration of the supported File Component Selector 2 codes as well as the ones specific to the Dataset.

The Vector dataset concept and the feature code concepts overlap somewhat; some of the Vector datasets are generalizations or specializations of feature codes.  Note that the same feature should not have two representations.

== Layer Names within a GeoPackage

Each GeoPackage file shall contain one and only one feature table. The feature table shall include all attributes (fields) required by the CDB standard (Volume 1, 5.7.1.2. CDB Attribution). The single feature table shall be named identically to the GeoPackage filename (not including the ".gpkg" filename extension). A GeoPackage file may include an optional extended level attribute table. The extended level attribute table shall not contain geometry. The name of the extended level attribute table shall use the CS2 selector shown in Table 2. Table 3 shows the file naming convention.

|Dnnn	| Character D followed by the 3-digit code assigned to the dataset.
|Snnn | Character S followed by the 3-digit value of Component Selector 1.
|Tnnn | Character T followed by the 3-digit value of Component Selector 2.
|LOD | Level of Detail – As defined in section 3.3.8.5, Level of Detail.
|Un | UREF – Identical to the name of the directory as defined in section 3.6.2.5, Directory Level 5 (UREF Directory).
|Rn | RREF – A reference to the Right Index of a tile. Character R (Right direction) followed by the column number as described in this section.
