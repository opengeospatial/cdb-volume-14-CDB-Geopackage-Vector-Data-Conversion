== Flattening the Schema
The CDB Shapefile standard provides three attribution schemas to represent attribution data.  Those three have been flattened into two for use with GeoPackage.  

•	Instance-level attribution schema
•	Extended-level attribution schema

As CNAM in the CDB Shapefile schema was only used as a relationship field, it has been removed from the flattened schema. Figure 1 shows the flattened instance and class-level attributes, and how the extended attributes link to a feature. I_CEAI, I_GEAI, and I_VEAI are all instance-level attributes and are linked to a specific feature.  C_CEAI, C_GEAI, and C_VEAI are all class-level attributes and are linked to all features in a layer.

Example: 
Record ID 4 in the extended-level attributes table is related to record ID 1 in the linear features table and is an instance-level attribute.  Record IDs 5 and 8 are also linked to record ID 4, and all apply to the same linear feature.  Note that a 0 in the LNK column denotes the end of the applicable record list. 
Record 9 in the extended-level attributes table is a class-level attribute related to all features that are present in the highway layer.

All of the information that is needed to instance features is organized in accordance to the CDB tile structure.  All the tiled GeoPackage dataset files are located in the same directory. The dataset’s second component selector (CS2) is used to differentiate between files with the same extension or with the same Vector features.  Table 1 presents the list of codes that are allocated.  Note that Vector datasets do not necessarily use all of the Dataset Component Selector 2 reserved codes.  Users of the CDB standard should refer to the appropriate section for an enumeration of the supported File Component Selector 2 codes as well as the ones specific to the Dataset.

The Vector dataset concept and the feature code concepts overlap somewhat; some of the Vector datasets are generalizations or specializations of feature codes.  Note that the same feature should not have two representations.

== Layer Names within a GeoPackage

Each GeoPackage file shall contain one and only one feature table. The feature table shall include all attributes (fields) required by the CDB standard (Volume 1, 5.7.1.2. CDB Attribution). The single feature table shall be named identically to the GeoPackage filename (not including the ".gpkg" filename extension). A GeoPackage file may include an optional extended level attribute table. The extended level attribute table shall not contain geometry. The name of the extended level attribute table shall use the CS2 selector shown in Table 2. Table 3 shows the file naming convention.

== Sample Conversion Tools
Sample conversion tools may be found in the Cognitics GitHub repo located at https://github.com/Cognitics/cdb-shp-geopackage-convert.

*Warning: Use the sample conversion code at your own risk. It is intended to provide an example on how to convert Shapefiles to GeoPackage in a CDB, and is not an OGC tested application. Make sure you test on a backup copy of your CDB first.*

The sample converter is written in Python, and uses GDAL (version 2.2.3 or greater) with the Python bindings. Binaries of GDAL can be found at https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries.

To use the sample converter tool, use the following Syntax:

    Usage: Convert.py <Input Root CDB Directory> <Output Directory for GeoPackage Files>

The converter starts by calling the function:

    generateMetaFiles.generateMetaFiles(cDBRoot)

This function scans the CDB to find a list of Shapefiles. It stores a list of all Shapefiles in a file called shapeindex.py. Another file named shapemeta.py is generated with a list of shapefiles and the extents of each file. 

The shapemeta.py file is not necessary for the conversion, but can be useful for analysis. That block of code can be removed for a faster conversion if it isn't needed.

Next, the index file is scanned, and each ShapeFile is processed through:

    copyFeaturesFromShapeToGeoPackage(shpFilename,outputGeoPackageFile)

If the shapefile passed through this function is a feature file, and not a feature class or extended attribute file, the appropriate feature class and extended attributes DBF file (based on Selector2 in the filename) is ready by calling readDBF. All records in each file are read and stored in a dictionary.

Next, GDAL is used to create the appropriate GeoPackage file and layers. Then GDAL is used to open the ShapeFile and iterate through each feature. To flatten the feature class records, as each feature is read, any matching feature class records (based on the CNAM attribute) are added to the feature record.

After copyFeaturesFromShapeToGeoPackage has completed, the extended attribute DBF file that matches the feature file is read. The appropriate layer is created in the GeoPackage. The name of that layer is identical to the filename of the extended attribute DBF file, without the .dbf extension. Each record in the extended attribute DBF file is read and added to the new layer in the GeoPackage. Each record from the DFB file is copied into the GeoPackage layer.

Note that no additional relationships or foreign keys are necessary. The feature attributes that are used to link the features to the Extended Attributes in the GeoPackage are the same as the attributes from the ShapeFile (CEAI,GEAI, and VEAI) and have been renamed to indicate either the Instance or Class level (see Figure 1 in section above on Flattening the Schema).

After each feature ShapeFile has been processed, the conversion is complete. Note that none of the associated ShapeFile or DBF files are removed from the CDB.
